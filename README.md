# Pothole Detection

In this project  we used an unsupervised method, which is based on image analysis and k-means clustering.
It is vision-based method, which does not require additional filtering and training phase. 
We use k-means clustering to identify regions by using histogram-based data from gray-scaled image. 
Based on results, we identify potholes and estimate its surface. Our method is suitable for rough estimation of potholes.
